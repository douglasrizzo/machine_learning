# Machine Learning algorithms in C++

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in C++. As of now, the following algorithms are available:

* k-nearest neighbors;
* principal component analysis;
* linear discriminant analysis;
* multi-layer perceptron;
* na√Øve Bayes classifier;
* k-means;
* least-squares.

There is also an implementation of a grid world, which can be solved by the following reinforcement learning algorithms:

* policy iteration;
* value iteration;
* Monte Carlo Estimating Starts (ES);
* Sarsa;
* Q-learning.
